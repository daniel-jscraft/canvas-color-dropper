# Canvas Color Dropper

Hi there ðŸ‘‹! You can check a brief intro for the project in this short movie: [https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/f4o5gqmmxu4y7n6onn8hj/11.mov](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/f4o5gqmmxu4y7n6onn8hj/11.mov?rlkey=ca7svmyuebvnybhn31d4raz0w&dl=0)

## How to run
Just download the code and open up `index.html`. No other setup should be needed. 

## Technical observations
- in other to have a minimal setup, I've used `babel.min.js` to translate the typescript code directly in the browser. Should not do this in production ðŸ˜….
- in the `assets` folder there are the images used for testing 
-Â during the development of this project only Google Chrome and Safari were used. Hope it works in all the other browsers ðŸ¤ž.
- you can customize the look and size of the tool by changing the constants between lines `44 - 49`.

Happy to make any other changes that are needed!
